# nodes.js-mongodb-and-mlab
Using of mongodb (online version mlab )
the working follow 
"index.html" for simple form with simple functionality
form "app.js" we will use every "router" which we have to exports from our "routers folder"
in the routers folder we have users.js which we get further single "user" data from the "models folder" from "model .js"

shoulds now about GET and POST routes difference
Get in losely coupled,meann you can seen every thing in URL with 128 char limited
POST is not limited, you can get encrypted data form the url, 
post and get method can use for the same purpose.....
